      "Reproducible cross-simulator benchmarking framework driving SUMO, MATSim and DTALite from a single byte-identical scenario bundle — open-sourced under Apache-2.0 with a citable Zenodo DOI.",
    description:
      "SimForge unifies three heterogeneous traffic engines under one canonical five-file scenario bundle (network, demand, signals, config, SHA-256 manifest) so any cross-engine travel-time delta is provably an engine-internal property, not an input asymmetry. A state-aware BFS pre-router enforces OSM turn-restrictions and strongly-connected-component feasibility, forcing every engine onto byte-identical canonical routes; deterministic route caching and 16-way parallelism cut shared-route pre-routing from 141.9 hours to 7.1 hours (20× cold-cache, 228× warm). Scaled to ~80K nodes / ~200K directed links across Chicago, NYC and LA at demand tiers up to 500K trips, calibrated against 2.4M–6.8M US Census PUMS persons, and deployed across the OSC Pitzer and Cardinal clusters — revealing regime-dependent cross-engine behavior with up to 96% travel-time divergence under saturation. Validated by ~570 pytest tests, mutation tests on load-bearing modules, byte-identity guards and Student's-t 95% CIs at 76% coverage. Released under Apache-2.0 with a citable Zenodo DOI (10.5281/zenodo.21385983); the paper is under review at IEEE T-ITS.",

Lumi auto-generates scored practice quizzes with full review, one-click flashcard decks, and a daily spaced-repetition queue that resurfaces cards right before they'd be forgotten, plus hands-free voice study, per-session notes and revisitable history. Underneath: Google OAuth, row-level security on every table, hardened SECURITY DEFINER RPCs, self-service account deletion and an admin analytics panel, with every AI call routed through a Vercel serverless function that verifies each caller's Supabase token, rejects anonymous calls and keeps the API key entirely server-side — with streaming responses and prompt caching on the LLM layer. Android and iOS companion apps are currently in development.",

      "Cityscape is an open-source C++ population-synthesis and geospatial demand-generation framework in Dr. DJ Rao's group at Miami University. I authored three merged C++ pull requests (PRs #1–#3) that fixed OSM building-classification and orphan-ring logic across five metros — collapsing synthetic-home ratios (LA ~70% → ~5%) and removing ~1.25M stranded-population artifacts across well over 1M building records. I exposed search-radius CLI flags and ran a 4-city HPC parameter sweep on OSC Pitzer that raised worst-case calibration R² from 0.812 to 0.917. The work feeds the SimForge thesis demand pipeline and underpins a first-author paper — \"CITYSCAPE: A Digital Twin Framework for Temporospatial Modeling of Work-Commute Dynamics\" — under review at Frontiers (2026).",
